# DjangoClubApp
A Django CRUD app for Clubs Management with user validation and authentication.

DISCLAIMER:

I created this project with the aim of reinforcing and revisiting basic Django concepts. Since it is a simple project, it does not adhere to the best programming practices, as a significant portion of the user authentication and validation logic is implemented on the front-end (HTML) using Jinja templating.
Please note that this project is intended for educational purposes and may not reflect industry-standard practices. It serves as a learning exercise and should not be used as a reference for production-ready applications.
