#### DISCLAIMER:

I created this project with the aim of reinforcing and revisiting basic Django concepts. Since it is a simple project, it does not adhere to the best programming practices, as a significant portion of the user authentication and validation logic is implemented on the front-end (HTML) using Jinja templating.
