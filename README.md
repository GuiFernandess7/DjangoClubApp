# Django Club App

### Introduction

The app is a Django-based web application designed to facilitate the management of clubs, events, and venues. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on events and venues. The application also supports authentication and authorization to ensure secure access and control over the system's functionalities.

### First access (when the user is not authenticated):

### Venues and Events Page:
<img src="previews/preview2.gif" alt="Descrição opcional" width="500px" />

### User login
<img src="previews/preview3.gif" alt="Descrição opcional" width="500px" />

### Adding event
<img src="previews/preview4.gif" alt="Descrição opcional" width="500px" />

### CSV and PDF Export: The app allows users to export venue data in CSV and PDF formats. To export the data, follow these steps:

* Navigate to the Downloads section in the navbar.
* Select the desired export format (CSV or PDF).
* Click the Export button.
* The file will be downloaded to your local machine.

#### DISCLAIMER:

I created this project with the aim of reinforcing and revisiting basic Django concepts. Since it is a simple project, it may not adhere to the best programming practices, as some of the user authentication and validation logic is implemented on the front-end (HTML) using Jinja templating. Feel free to modify and enhance its functionalities.
